He speaks of international control of Russian nuclear weapons and facilities!
Though it is a great idea to have international control of all nuclear weapons and facilities in the world in a mutually verifiable and controlled manner so that no one can use them under any circumstances.
I think there was one system between Russia and USA for such mutually verifiable though not controllable till very recently till it was scrapped by one of the less sane presidents of USA.
The only major country unwilling for a treaty on cyber attacks, hacking etc appears to be usa. I find china and Russia have been proposing repeatedly for a treaty on cyber matters that applies equally to all countries.
Perhaps usa can never accept to be an equal country with anyone in any matter holding up the flag of American exceptionalism .
So the Ukraine war, May lay down some good ground on  how far a military alliance can go near the border of another super power, and If so called sovereign countries really have the sovereign power to enter and station, receive and export arms as they line based on their choices.
Will usa and UK and European Union accept that kind of sovereignty? 
Perhaps some Russian and Chinese and Iranian presence in Venezuela  and Cuba to begin with and expanded to other South American countries willing to partner with them, then Asia and one day soon some place in Europe in the middle of Western Europe.
If Finland and Norway join NATO that may be next expected thing! 
Will usa and europe accept that or threaten nuclear war against China and Russia.
A usa destroyer seems to be passing through Taiwan straights!
May be some day soon Russian and Chinese ships will pass usa and European coasts in international waters in a similar manner.

""... repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand"" (Matthew 3:1-2) God demands repentance from everyone, for ""there is no righteous man on earth who does good and does not sin"" (Eccl. 7:20)...""
‚ÄúNone is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, 
not even one.‚Äù(Rom. 3:10-12).

""And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of Man: they
ate, drank, married, married, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed everyone.
Just as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, drank, bought, sold, planted, built; but on the day that Lot left Sodom, a rain of fire and brimstone fell from heaven and destroyed everyone; so it will be on the day when the Son of Man appears. On that day, whoever is on the roof, and his things are in the house, do not go down to take them; and whoever is in the field, also do not turn back. Remember Lotova's wife.
Whoever saves his soul will destroy it; and whoever destroys it will revive it.
I tell you: that night there will be two on the same bed: one will take, and the other will remain; two will grind together: one will take, and the other will remain; two will be in the field: one will take, and the other will remain.""
(Luke 17:26-36)

""Take heed to yourselves, so that your hearts are not burdened with overeating and drunkenness and the cares of life, and that that day does not suddenly overtake you, for it will find like a net on all those who live on the whole face of the earth; therefore, watch at all times and pray that you may be worthy to avoid all these future disasters and appear before the Son of Man"" (Luke 21:34-36)

""Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour at which the Son of Man will come.""
(Matthew 25:13)

10 And he said to me, Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand.
11 Let the unrighteous still do unrighteousness; let the unclean still be defiled; let the righteous still do righteousness, and let the holy one be sanctified still.
12 Behold, I am coming soon, and my retribution is with me, to reward everyone according to his deeds.
13 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the First and the Last.
14 Blessed are those who keep his commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life and enter the city through the gates.
15 But outside are dogs, and sorcerers, and adulterers, and murderers, and idolaters, and everyone who loves and does unrighteousness.
16 I, Jesus, have sent my angel to witness these things to you in the churches. I am the root and descendant of David, the bright and morning star.
17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who hears say: Come! Let him who is thirsty come, and let him who is willing take the water of life for free.
20 He who bears witness to this says, ""To her, I am coming soon!"" Amen. To her, come, Lord Jesus!
21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with you all. Amen.""
