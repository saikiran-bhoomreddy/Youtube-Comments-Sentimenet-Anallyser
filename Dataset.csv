ZELV_th4dG0,Ugy__pZMoX-ryRrMHBR4AaABAg,Cutting  gas  to  EU  countries  is  painful  in  the  short  term  but  good  in  the  long  term    It  will  force  the  EU  to  diversify  its  gas  supply  and  to  stop  getting  gas  and  oil  from  Russia    regardless  of  who  Russias  leader  is  
ZELV_th4dG0,Ugz_fXRSR7537r8_b-F4AaABAg,This  is  all  about  increasing  demand  for  the  rouble  by  forcing  countries  to  buy  it      The  currency  has  lost  a  lot  of  value  and  is  being  artificially  propped  up  with  things  like  high  interest  rates  and  cash  injections  and  can't  be  maintained  forever      It  might  help  in  the  short  term    but  Russia's  biggest  problem  will  be  losing  40    of  their  GDP  as  Europe  moves  to  other  sources  for  gas  
ZELV_th4dG0,UgyOp30CVXp9vs-Xk294AaABAg,Poland  is  fully  diversified  by  other  sources  and  was  planning  to  cut  off  from  Russian  gas  in  September  anyway    So  Russia  basically  sanctioned  itself  as  it  will  simply  not  get  the  rest  of  the  money  from  the  contract  which  was  supposed  to  work  until  September        
ZELV_th4dG0,UgxxuEJWCNGlkI3DA5J4AaABAg,Not  gonna  lie  BBC    the  dub  voice  you  chose  for  Zelensky  made  him  sound  like  a  James  Bond  villain
ZELV_th4dG0,UgwxbRxCcpoC-kyNitd4AaABAg,If  you  are  selling  something    you  are  fully  entitled  to  ask  to  be  paid  in  what  you  want    No  one  is  forcing  them  to  buy  Russian  gas  
ZELV_th4dG0,Ugy0PInAXyQRpmblub94AaABAg,Both  country  already  given  notice  that  they  wont  renew  the  contract  and  they  refused  to  pay  in  ruble            Poland  is  still  getting  Russian  gas  through  Germany    This  was  in  March    WARSAW    Reuters        Poland's  dominant  gas  firm    state  run  PGNiG    said  on  Friday  it  had  notified  Russia's  Gazprom  that  it  will  not  renew  their  long  term  deal  on  gas  supplies  when  the  agreement  expires  after  2022  
ZELV_th4dG0,UgyEZHLiLDVl4oO2egV4AaABAg,Let  s  think  this  through    the  US  tells  the  EU  NATO  that  economic  sanctions  must  be  strictly  followed  against  Russia  or  else    Russia  says  to  the  U  S    and  it  s  subordinates  you  have  frozen  our  foreign  reserves    Consequently    if  you  pay  for  our  oil  and  gas  shipments  to  you  in  dollars  or  Euros  than  we  cannot  utilize  your  payments    Now    pay  for  your  purchases  to  us  in  our  currency  so  that  we  can  effectively  use  those  payments    No  pay  no  product

ZELV_th4dG0,UgwEoANNmttSjCaXBod4AaABAg,Many  have  said  relying  HEAVILY  on  Russia  for  energy  was  a  mistake    Russia  just  proved  why  it  was  a  mistake    time  to  move  away  from  fossil  fuels  and  invest  in  solar    wind    hydro  and  nuclear    yes    nuclear    Both  fission  and  fusion    
ZELV_th4dG0,Ugza_TfvlxxL3_Y4V6J4AaABAg,No  matter  what  your  wife  says    it's  not  healthy  to  hold  the  gas  in    You  will  keep  Putin  and  she  will  get  over  it  
ZELV_th4dG0,UgwjSpdkxi42TcrBXuV4AaABAg,Russia  wants  to  be  a  country  independent  of  the  unreliable  financial  system  of  the  West    She  just  asks  to  pay  in  rubles  for  gas    All  other  terms  of  the  contracts  are  strictly  observed    What  is  the  problem    Poland  and  Bulgaria  just  don't  need  gas  
ZELV_th4dG0,UgzsXw3Vf6NSFooLayJ4AaABAg,This  is  Russia's  own  form  of  sanctioning  other  countries  
ZELV_th4dG0,UgxgMgB7DUJdwqNw9Nd4AaABAg,It  is  time  for  countries  to  stop  relying  on  fossil  fuel  dependency  considering  that  the  planet  is  warming  every  second  of  everyday  and  night    The  current  conflict  in  Ukraine  is  also  increasing  planet  warming  due  to  toxic  gases  and  other  environmental  pollutants  being  emitted

ZELV_th4dG0,Ugz5nC7WJ93R0ZGFIbF4AaABAg,Bulgaria  has  an  lng  terminal  that  has  the  capacity  to  convert  6  times  as  much  gas  as  they  actually  use  so  they  have  just  become  a  net  exporter  to  the  Europe    They  got  77    of  the  gas  needs  from  Russia  because  it  was  easy  not  because  they  needed  to

ZELV_th4dG0,UgzbQTs5LHAtsxc2oqh4AaABAg,I  love  this  video  at  large  but  I  will  advice  everybody  who  is  into  crypto  to  stick  with  ETH  and  BTC  as  much  as  you  can  guys  If  everyone  sells  when  it  starts  to  fall    which  at  one  point  it  will    the  dream  maybe  lost  because  of  it  being  too  volatile  for  companies  to  get  behind  
ZELV_th4dG0,UgzrD0ouKJoJc3QEbh14AaABAg,Maybe  Russia  can't  deliver  gas  to  Poland  and  Bulgaria  instead  of  won't  deliver
